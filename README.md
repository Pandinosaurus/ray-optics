# Ray Optics Simulation
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6386611.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6386611)

A web app for creating and simulating 2D geometric optical scenes. Our goal is to make it easy for students to build physical intuition by "playing around", for teachers to do dynamical demonstrations, and at the same time also include tools for more advanced usage.

## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, parallel/divergent beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in linear or curved mirrors, which can be defined by a custom equation
- Simulate beam splitters and dichroic mirrors
- Simulate refraction in linear or curved interfaces, which can be defined by a custom equation
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obey the lens/mirror equation
- Simulate spherical lens defined by front/back focal distances
- Simulate gradient-index material defined by a custom refractive index function
- Simulate mixture of colors, color filtering, and chromatic dispersion
- Simulate diffraction gratings.
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images, and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance, angular, energy flow, and momentum flow measurements
- Draw irradiance map and export as CSV data
- Export as SVG diagram
- Create modularized combinations of optical elements with custom parameters.
- Use the simulator as a node module in your own project.

## Cite this project

If you use this project in your research, please cite it using the metadata in the [CITATION.bib](https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics/blob/master/CITATION.bib) file.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For the following types of contributions, no (or little) programming knowledge is required:

- New items in the [gallery](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics/gallery/)
- New translations
- New modules (as in Tools -> Other -> Import Modules)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the tutorial.

To contribute code, you need to have some knowledge of JavaScript and module bundling. The code is written in ES6 and bundled with Webpack. The code structure is documented in the [documentation](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics/docs/). See the following section for installation instructions.

# Installation

**Note: The following instructions are for developers. If you just want to use the simulator, you can launch the web app directly from [here](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics/simulator/).**

To install the project locally, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics.git
cd ray-optics
npm install
npm run build
```
After that, the entire content for the [https://phydemo.app/ray-optics](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics) website will be in the `dist` folder. For example, you can open the `dist/simulator/index.html` file in your browser to run the simulator.

## Development

For development, you don't need to build the entire website every time some code is changed. Instead, you can run the following command to start a local server:
```bash
npm run start
```
which serves the simulator app at `http://localhost:8080`, and is automatically reloaded when some code for the simulator is modified. However, this does not include other part of this project such as the home pages, gallery and documentation. The separate build commands are available for these pages:
```bash
npm run build-translations # build translations
npm run build-webpages # build home pages, about pages, gallery, and modules pages.
npm run build-simulator # build simulator (unlike npm run start, this command builds the simulator in production mode)
npm run build-docs # build documentation
```
Note that `npm run build` is equivalent to running all the above commands.

If you add new translatable strings to `src/translations/en.json`, you can run the following command to synchronize the strings to other languages so that translators can see the new strings to translate:
```bash
npm run sync-translations
```

## Project structure

- `src` contains the source code for the project.
- `src/simulator` contains the source code for the simulator app. To understand the structure of the code, see the [documentation](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics/docs/) for more information. The documentation is generated from the jsdoc comments in the code.
- `src/webpages` contains the code for the home pages, about pages, templates for gallery and module pages, and the JSON files for the gallery and modules.
- `locales` contains the translations for the project. Currently it is only automatically built for the simulator app. The translations for the webpages, gallery, and modules pages are manually built.
- `scripts` contains the scripts for custom build steps.
- `dist` contains the built files for the project (the entire content for the [https://phydemo.app/ray-optics](https://phydemo.app/ray-optics) website).
